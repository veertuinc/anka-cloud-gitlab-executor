# Anka Cloud Gitlab Executor Agent Guidelines

1. Keep code D.R.Y (Don't Repeat Yourself) to avoid code duplication and improve readability.
2. Use meaningful variable names that can be read by a human easily.
3. Prioritize adding logs and having the developer run the code locally to debug issues if you don't know the answer.
